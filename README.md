# UnitychanRPG

Help Unity-chan escape from this unknown cavern! Press the things, punch the
objects, and move forth towards freedom! A top-down 2D dot game about exploration
and the bonds of friendship.

This project is primarily intended as a learning tool for 2D projects in Unity
using the 2D tilemap system introduced in beta in Unity 2018.

## Building

Last compiled against Unity 2018.2.0f2.

At this time, Windows is the only supported platform, but it should support
other standalone targets for desktop as well.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Figure out how to deal with entities like doors and levers
- [ ] Make a less jank character controller for 2D top-down grid based levels
  - Should the player fit through 1x1 zones? (It does so now by having a smaller collider).
